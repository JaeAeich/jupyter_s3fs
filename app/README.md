# App

This is the user-facing frontend for interacting with the dashboard, serving as
the GUI (also referred to as the `dashboard`, `platform`, or `frontend`). This
service enables users to upload files, define workflow parameters, and set
tags based on a predetermined schema.

As a Proof of Concept (PoC), it sends file attachments and metadata to the `server`.
